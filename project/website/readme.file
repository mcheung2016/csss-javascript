Website Description:
This website provides a user-friendly experience, guiding users through the account creation, login, and dashboard functionalities.

The sign-up page allows new users to create an account by providing details such as full name, email, phone number, and how they heard about the service. Users can also select their preferred contact method (email or phone). Upon submission, the form is validated in real-time, ensuring accurate input. Validation errors are highlighted immediately to provide a sign-up process.

Once registered, users are directed to the login page, where they can securely access their account with real-time validation of their credentials.

After logging in, the dashboard presents users with a clean, easy-to-read table showing recent activities, such as login attempts and profile updates. Multimedia elements like videos and images enhance the user experience.
