				We believe in toothbrushes. Quality toothbrushes. Toothbrushes like:
				Soft bristles. Medium bristles. Firm bristles (for the daring). Manual
				toothbrushes. Electric toothbrushes. Biodegradable toothbrushes. Bamboo
				toothbrushes. Travel-sized toothbrushes. Toothbrushes with ergonomic
				handles. Sonic toothbrushes. Toothbrushes with tongue scrapers.
				Toothbrushes with timers. Toothbrushes for kidsâ€”rainbow-colored,
				dinosaur-shaped, superhero-themed, you name it. Toothbrushes for pets
				(yes, pets). Dual-head toothbrushes. What are we forgetting? Oh!
				Toothbrush holders. Toothbrush sanitizers. Toothbrush cases.
				Battery-powered toothbrushes. Toothbrushes with fancy LED lights.
				Toothbrushes that sync with your phone (because apparently, brushing
				needs an app). Eco-friendly toothbrushes made from recycled materials.
				Whitening toothbrushes. Toothbrushes with subscription plans.
				Toothbrushes for sensitive gums. Fluoride-infused bristles. The finest
				toothbrush town can offer.
